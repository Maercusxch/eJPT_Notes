# Footprinting & Scanning

It involves scanning open ports, mapping network topologies, and collecting information about hosts, their operating systems, IP addresses, and user accounts. This gathered data helps to generate a comprehensive technical blueprint of the target organization.

## Networking Fundamentals

### Packets

The primary goal of networking is the exchange information between networked computers; this information is transferred by packets. Packets are nothing but streams of bits running as electric signals on physical media used for data transmission(Ethernet, Wi-Fi etc). These electrical signals are then interpreted as bits (zeros and ones) that make up the information.

- **Header:** The header contains information about the packet, such as its origin and destination IP addresses
The header has a protocol-specific structure: this ensures that the receiving host can correctly interpret the payload and handle the overall communication.
- **Payload:** The Payload is the actual Data.
